ID GENERATION
INTRODUCTION
My project allows users (students) to access their school profile and request for their ID card. I wasn’t able to find a team member so I tasked myself with working on the whole project. My project will be useful for schools for issues with their ID card management system.

INSTALLATION
Download Xampp and Vscode.
Ensure the file is downloaded into the xampp folder.
Run the code.
Sign up as an Admin.

USAGE
It can be used to enable easy generation of ID cards.
